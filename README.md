# Sizi's Personal Portfolio Website

Welcome to my portfolio project!

Welcome to the repository of my portfolio website, Sizi.Dev.App! This website is designed and built using Figma, React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion. It serves as a platform to showcase various projects and experiences. Feel free to fork, tinker, or even steal few ideas.

The project is made with Vite & React and styled with Tailwind & Framer Motion. It has been deployed and is accessible online via Vercel at [IvanSkara.dev](https://plantpulse.vercel.app/).
